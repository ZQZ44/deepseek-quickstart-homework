# Todo List (Optional - Plan Mode)



While in PLAN MODE, if you've outlined concrete steps or requirements for the user, you may include a preliminary todo list using the task_progress parameter.

Reminder on how to use the task_progress parameter:



1. To create or update a todo list, include the task_progress parameter in the next tool call

2. Review each item and update its status:

   - Mark completed items with: - [x]

   - Keep incomplete items as: - [ ]

   - Add new items if you discover additional steps

3. Modify the list as needed:

		- Add any new steps you've discovered

		- Reorder if the sequence has changed

4. Ensure the list accurately reflects the current state



**Remember:** Keeping the todo list updated helps track progress and ensures nothing is missed.

PLAN MODE
In this mode you should focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution. Once you have a plan, use the plan_mode_respond tool to engage in a conversational back and forth with the user. Do not use the plan_mode_respond tool until you've gathered all the information you need e.g. with read_file or ask_followup_question.
(Remember: If it seems the user wants you to use tools only available in Act Mode, you should ask the user to "toggle to Act mode" (use those words) - they will have to manually do this themselves with the Plan/Act toggle button below. You do not have the ability to switch to Act Mode yourself, and must wait for the user to do it themselves once they are satisfied with the plan. You also cannot present an option to toggle to Act mode, as this will be something you need to direct the user to do manually themselves.)

用户想要了解美国加州现在的天气情况。从环境信息中可以看到，当前目录下有一个weather.py文件，这应该是一个天气相关的MCP服务器。我需要先查看这个文件的内容来了解如何获取天气信息。

从MCP服务器信息中可以看到，有一个名为"weather"的服务器提供了两个工具：
1. get_alerts - 获取美国某个州当前生效的天气预警信息
2. get_forecast - 根据经纬度获取天气预报

用户想要了解加州的天气，我需要先查看weather.py文件来了解如何使用这些工具，以及是否需要特定的参数（比如加州的经纬度坐标）。

让我先读取weather.py文件来了解其结构和使用方法。

现在我已经了解了项目结构。看起来这个MCP服务器已经配置好了，但是没有预设的坐标信息。为了获取加州的天气预报，我需要加州的经纬度坐标。

我知道加州的主要城市如洛杉矶、旧金山等的坐标，但我需要向用户确认他们想要哪个具体地点的天气信息，或者使用一个代表性的坐标（比如加州首府萨克拉门托）。

让我使用plan_mode_respond来询问用户他们想要加州哪个具体城市的天气信息，或者确认是否可以使用一个代表性的坐标。
</thinking>

<plan_mode_respond>
<response>
我已经查看了这个天气MCP服务器的代码。它提供了两个工具：

1. `get_alerts(state: str)` - 获取某个州的天气预警信息（需要两个字母的州代码，如CA代表加州）
2. `get_forecast(latitude: float, longitude: float)` - 根据经纬度获取天气预报

要获取加州的天气预报，我需要具体的经纬度坐标。加州面积很大，不同地区的天气可能有所不同。

您希望我获取加州哪个具体城市的天气信息？比如：
- 洛杉矶 (纬度: 34.0522, 经度: -118.2437)
- 旧金山 (纬度: 37.7749, 经度: -122.4194)  
- 萨克拉门托 (加州首府，纬度: 38.5816, 经度: -121.4944)
- 圣地亚哥 (纬度: 32.7157, 经度: -117.1611)

或者您有其他特定的加州地点吗？

一旦您确认了具体地点，我就可以使用MCP工具来获取详细的天气预报信息。

1. Include the task_progress parameter in your next tool call

2. Create a comprehensive checklist of all steps needed

3. Use markdown format: - [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for complete



**Benefits of creating a todo list now:**

	- Clear roadmap for implementation

	- Progress tracking throughout the task

	- Nothing gets forgotten or missed

	- Users can see, monitor, and edit the plan



**Example structure:**
```

- [ ] Analyze requirements

- [ ] Set up necessary files

- [ ] Implement main functionality

- [ ] Handle edge cases

- [ ] Test the implementation

- [ ] Verify results
